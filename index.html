            <h1>A little about me...</h1>
            <p>I was born on an Air Force Base in Florida and have lived in various places around the world. My family settled in Tacoma, WA when I was 16. Since then, I have managed Burger King Restaurants, run a forklift for K-Mart and served in the US Air Force. My experience serving as a Youth Pastor, Adjunct Professor, College Admissions Counselor and Senior pastor have taken me all over the Northwest. As the executive leader of a thriving event planning company, I developed an understanding of what it takes to succeed in business.  My world travels and pastoral work have contributed to a deep understanding of different people and how to connect on meaningful levels.<br/>  
            I have been married to my wife, Lisa, for over 30 years (although it feels like yesterday) and we have 3 kids – Joshua (29), Timothy (27) and Carolynn (22). My favorite ice cream is vanilla, because it’s like a blank canvas – it can become anything you want it to be.</p>
